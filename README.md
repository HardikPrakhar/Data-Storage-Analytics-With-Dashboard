# School_Management_System
This is a student data management system that stores all the basic information of a student including their attendance and percentage. This data is entered through a desktop-based application connected to a database that updates the data on a web server when a stable connection is available. This platform-dependent desktop application was created using Javascript, HTML, CSS. Firebase was used for database management. It syncs data when we have a stable connection.

This data can be retrieved for every school in the district by a web server. That was created with Javascript, HTML, CSS.
