            Right to Education
          </h1>
          <p>
            <br />
            The Constitution (Eighty-sixth Amendment) Act, 2002 inserted Article
            21-A in the Constitution of India to provide free and compulsory
            education of all children in the age group of six to fourteen years
            as a Fundamental Right in such a manner as the State may, by law,
            determine. The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education
            (RTE) Act, 2009, which represents the consequential legislation
            envisaged under Article 21-A, means that every child has a right to
            full time elementary education of satisfactory and equitable quality
            in a formal school which satisfies certain essential norms and
            standards.
          <br /><br />
            Article 21-A and the RTE Act came into effect on 1 April 2010. The
            title of the RTE Act incorporates the words ‘free and compulsory’.
            ‘Free education’ means that no child, other than a child who has
            been admitted by his or her parents to a school which is not
            supported by the appropriate Government, shall be liable to pay any
            kind of fee or charges or expenses which may prevent him or her from
            pursuing and completing elementary education. ‘Compulsory education’
            casts an obligation on the appropriate Government and local
            authorities to provide and ensure admission, attendance and
            completion of elementary education by all children in the 6-14 age
            group. With this, India has moved forward to a rights based
            framework that casts a legal obligation on the Central and State
            Governments to implement this fundamental child right as enshrined
            in the Article 21A of the Constitution, in accordance with the
            provisions of the RTE Act.
          <br/><br />
            The RTE Act provides for the:
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Right of children to free and compulsory education till completion
              of elementary education in a neighbourhood school.
            </li>
            <li>
              It clarifies that ‘compulsory education’ means obligation of the
              appropriate government to provide free elementary education and
              ensure compulsory admission, attendance and completion of
              elementary education to every child in the six to fourteen age
              group. ‘Free’ means that no child shall be liable to pay any kind
              of fee or charges or expenses which may prevent him or her from
              pursuing and completing elementary education.
            </li>
            <li>
              It makes provisions for a non-admitted child to be admitted to an
              age appropriate class.
            </li>
            <li>
              It specifies the duties and responsibilities of appropriate
              Governments, local authority and parents in providing free and
              compulsory education, and sharing of financial and other
              responsibilities between the Central and State Governments.
            </li>
            <li>
              It lays down the norms and standards relating inter alia to Pupil
              Teacher Ratios (PTRs), buildings and infrastructure,
              school-working days, teacher-working hours.
            </li>
            <li>
              It provides for rational deployment of teachers by ensuring that
              the specified pupil teacher ratio is maintained for each school,
              rather than just as an average for the State or District or Block,
              thus ensuring that there is no urban-rural imbalance in teacher
              postings. It also provides for prohibition of deployment of
              teachers for non-educational work, other than decennial census,
              elections to local authority, state legislatures and parliament,
              and disaster relief.
            </li>
            <li>
              It provides for appointment of appropriately trained teachers,
              i.e. teachers with the requisite entry and academic
              qualifications.
            </li>
            <li>
              It prohibits (a) physical punishment and mental harassment; (b)
              screening procedures for admission of children; (c) capitation
              fee; (d) private tuition by teachers and (e) running of schools
              without recognition,
            </li>
            <li>
              It provides for development of curriculum in consonance with the
              values enshrined in the Constitution, and which would ensure the
              all-round development of the child, building on the child’s
              knowledge, potentiality and talent and making the child free of
              fear, trauma and anxiety through a system of child friendly and
              child centred learning.
            </li>
